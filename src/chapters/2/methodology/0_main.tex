\section{Methodology} The methodology is structured into three sequential phases, each addressing a distinct part of our multi-dimensional analysis. In Phase I we develop a holistic taxonomy-based representation of security faults. In Phase II we construct an automated data-extraction pipeline to collect and aggregate vulnerability records. In Phase III we perform exploratory analysis on the dataset and derive a hierarchical classification scheme based on observed patterns. Each phase builds on the previous, ensuring a coherent flow from abstract taxonomy to concrete classification.
