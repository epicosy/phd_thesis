\section{Dissertation Structure} \label{sec:struct}

In addition to the introduction, this dissertation contains 8 more chapters. Chapter 2 reviews the relevant background and related work in vulnerability detection and program repair. Chapter 3 presents the profiling of security faults and discusses patterns observed across real-world software. Chapter 4 describes the construction of the benchmark dataset used in subsequent experiments. Chapter 5 provides a comparative analysis of existing APR and SVD tools in terms of their vulnerability coverage and performance. Chapter 6 introduces and evaluates the hybrid repair approach combining APR with static vulnerability detection. Chapter 7 explores the integration of ML-based detection with SAST tools in a collaborative setting. Chapter 8 discusses the key findings, implications, and limitations of the work. Chapter 9 concludes the thesis and outlines directions for future research.
